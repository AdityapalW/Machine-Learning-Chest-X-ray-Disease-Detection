# Machine-Learning-Chest-X-ray-Disease-Detection
A deep learning project for automated chest X-ray analysis using CNNs. It predicts the likelihood of thoracic diseases like pneumonia, cardiomegaly, and emphysema from NIH Chest X-ray images. Built with PyTorch/TensorFlow for preprocessing, training, and evaluation to support AI-based medical screening.
